    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Lasagna is a classic Italian dish loved for its rich flavors and comforting warmth. It's made with layers of wide pasta sheets, alternating with meat sauce, béchamel sauce, and cheese. The meat sauce is typically made with ground beef or pork, simmered with tomatoes, garlic, and herbs. The béchamel sauce is a creamy mixture of milk, butter, and flour. The lasagna is then baked in the oven until bubbly and golden brown, creating a satisfying and hearty meal.</p>
    <p>Lasagna is a versatile dish that can be adapted to suit various dietary preferences. Vegetarians can enjoy lasagna by substituting the meat sauce with a flavorful vegetable-based ragu. Additionally, there are countless variations on the cheese component, from traditional Parmesan and mozzarella to more adventurous choices like ricotta or goat cheese. No matter the variation, lasagna remains a beloved comfort food that brings people together.</p>
